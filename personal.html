    In my life, I fill so many roles. During my undergraduate study I majored in economics, and participated extensively in debate society and had experiences as a graphic desinger.
</p>
<p>Last year I acquired my bachelor's degree in economics. But with an strong interest in proramming and extensive leaning resouces online, I pick up the programming skills by doing throughout several projects.
    economics. But after graduation from Nottingham, I became an IOS developer in a Chinese startup.

    After working in the industry for one year, I realize that my curiosity and passion for exploration is driving me to step further for a more theoretical framewok and a more structured academic training.
    On this note, I apply to come to the <span class="stanford">Stanford</span> Summer, taking some courses as a transition for me between the industry and school. I expect this experience would not only enrich myself, but also bring more insightful thinking and vision.
    As one of the top universities in the world, <span class="stanford">Stanford</span> never fails to follow the world leading trends, especially in the technological area. I believe this summer in <span class="stanford">Stanford </span>will bring me some valuable transformations.
